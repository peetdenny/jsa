                <p>The JSA was started by Indigo and Peet Denny in April 2014 when they spotted the International Space Station flying over their house in Windsor (UK, not Ontario), closely followed by the <a class="in-text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progress_M-23M">Progress M-23M</a> resupply spacecraft that had just launched from Baikonur, Kazakhstan earlier that day.
                    The smouldering fuse of their enthusiasm then wafted into a dangerous and unpredictable bonfire when they discovered <a class="in-text" href="https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/en/">Kerbal Space Program</a> and model rockets!
                </p>

                <br><br>


                <p>They are now building and flying bigger and bigger rockets and learning all about thrust, aerodynamics, modelling, delta-V, launch systems, parachutes, payloads and all that fun stuff.
                    It's their goal to get some video and other fun electronic sensor equipment up to 1km above the Earth's crust, and to ultimately get some kind of vehicle (probably a weather balloon) up to space!!!!11123
